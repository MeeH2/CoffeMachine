Coffee Machine

This is a simple Python program that simulates a coffee machine. The machine accepts orders for three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

Features

The machine maintains an inventory of water, milk, coffee, and money.
Customers can order one of three types of coffee. Each type of coffee requires different amounts of water, milk, and coffee.
The machine checks if it has enough resources to make the ordered coffee. If not, it informs the customer about the missing resource.
If the machine has enough resources, it will process the customer's payment. The machine only accepts quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. It will calculate the total amount of money inserted and check if it is enough to pay for the ordered coffee.
If the customer inserted enough money, the machine will calculate the change, if any, and add the cost of the coffee to its money.
The machine can also print a report showing the amounts of resources it currently has and the money it has made.
Usage

To use this program, you can clone this repository and run the program. When the program is running, it will ask what type of coffee you would like to order. You can type either "espresso", "latte", "cappuccino", or "report".

Conclusion

This Python program is a great practice for beginners to work with functions, loops, and data structures like dictionaries. It involves the concepts of control flow and simple arithmetic operations as well. It also provides a brief insight into how a real-world machine like a coffee machine can be modeled using programming.

I hope this provides a good starting point for your README file! You can customize it further to better fit your needs or the context of your project.
